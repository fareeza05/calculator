## Conclusion 
---
This project has furthered my Javascript skills, because now beyond just working with event listeners I have had to work with complexly interlinked functions within the class I made. This project has by far been the most JS heavy one out of all the TOP projects and is the perfect one for wrapping up my basic web development lesson.
